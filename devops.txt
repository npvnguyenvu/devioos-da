The best part of coding is watching it work.My code works… I have no idea why.A true programmer never blames the compiler.There’s no such thing as a simple software project.Hello, world!Programming is like writing a book… except if you miss a single comma, the whole thing crashes.Coding is 1% writing and 99% debugging.A good developer never stops learning.Real programmers don’t comment—if it was hard to write, it should be hard to understand.Commit messages should be as detailed as a tweet.Try, catch, cry.The best debugging strategy is to assume you’re wrong.Write code that even your grandma can understand.Hello, world!Write tests like your life depends on them.Write code that even your grandma can understand.When in doubt, refactor.Code like you care.new dev
